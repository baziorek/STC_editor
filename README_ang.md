# STC Editor

A simple text editor built with Qt to streamline the insertion of [STC](https://cpp0x.pl/kursy/Kurs-STC/169) markup tags used by the [cpp0x.pl](https://cpp0x.pl/) platform.

## Overview

This editor is designed to simplify working with STC markup for creating content on [cpp0x.pl](https://cpp0x.pl/). It provides a straightforward Qt-based interface with a text widget and buttons for inserting STC tags, along with specialized features to enhance productivity.

## Dedicated Features

If you want to use this editor for writing content for [cpp0x.pl](https://cpp0x.pl/) (which I encourage):

1. **Syntax Highlighting**: Colorizes STC markup for better readability.
2. **Tag Closure Validation**: Checks if all STC tags are properly closed.
3. **Text Transformation**: Convert selected text to lowercase, uppercase, camelCase to snake_case, or vice versa.
4. **Document Context View**:
   - Detects tags (e.g., `[h1]Header[/h1]`), their line numbers, and content (e.g., "Header").
   - Allows jumping to specific document positions based on context.
   - Filters specific tags (e.g., only `[h1]` headers).
   - Tracks cursor position within the document context in real-time.
5. **Image Preview**: Hover over `[img src="path/to/image.png"]` to preview images, including web-hosted images (requires valid paths).
6. **Tag Removal**: Right-click inside tags (e.g., `[b]Bold text[/b]`) to remove the tags, leaving only the content (e.g., `Bold text`).
7. **C++ Code Formatting**: Right-click inside `[cpp]...[/cpp]` tags to format code using `clang-format` (requires `clang-format` installed). If a `.clang-format` file is present near the text file, it will be used; otherwise, the default "LLVM" style is applied.
8. **C++ Code Compilation**: Right-click inside `[cpp]...[/cpp]` tags to compile code using `g++` (requires `g++` installed).
9. **C++ Comment Removal**: Right-click inside `[cpp]...[/cpp]` tags to remove all C++ comments from the code (uses the [StripCppComments library](https://github.com/wtwhite/StripCppComments)). It also cleans up excessive empty lines, leaving a maximum of two consecutive empty lines.
10. **Clean Up Empty Lines**: Right-click inside any text to remove excessive empty lines, leaving a maximum of two consecutive empty lines. This is useful for cleaning up text after removing comments or for general text cleanup.
10. **File Statistics**: Displays STC-specific statistics, such as tag usage, alongside standard editor metrics.
10. **Breadcrumb Navigation**: A dynamically updated breadcrumb bar showing the current position in the STC document structure, with clickable navigation.
11. **Change Tracking**: Tracks modified lines using the [pydifflib-cpp](https://github.com/dominicprice/pydifflib-cpp) library.
12. **Code Block Listing**: A separate widget that tracks the positions of `[cpp]` and other code blocks in real-time.
13. **Dedicated Drag-and-Drop**: Drag files into the application for automatic handling:
    - Image file paths are wrapped in `[img src="path/to/dragged/image.png"]` tags.
    - Text files with C/C++ extensions are inserted and wrapped in `[cpp]...[/cpp]` tags.
    - Other text files are inserted and wrapped in `[code]...[/code]` tags.
14. **Real-Time Web Preview**: Uses the [STC-to-HTML conversion backend](https://cpp0x.pl/stc/) to preview content in real-time. Statistics (data sent/received) are shown on hover over the rendering area.
15. **TODO Tracking**: Displays `TODO:` comments in the document context view, clickable to jump to their position.
16. **Clickable Links**: Hold `Ctrl` and left-click inside `[a href="..."]` or `[a href="..." name="..."]` tags to open the link.
17. **Smart Link Pasting**: Pasting a URL via `Ctrl+V` wraps it in `[a href="link"]` tags:
    - After a moment, the page title is fetched and added as a `name` attribute (e.g., `[a href="link" name="Page title"]`).
    - If text is selected, it becomes the link's name (e.g., `[a href="link" name="Selected text"]`).
    - If pasted inside `[img src=""]`, the URL is inserted as plain text.
18. **Table Pasting**: Pasting tabular data wraps it in `[csv]...[/csv]` tags with cells separated by semicolons. If the text contains tags, cells are wrapped in `[run]` tags, and the table becomes `[csv ext]`.
19. **Rich Text Pasting**: Pasting HTML from websites or Office applications partially converts it to STC tags (e.g., links, bold text).
20. **Tag Attribute Management**: Right-click on tags with optional attributes to add/remove them via the context menu.
21. **Smart STC Tag Buttons**: Buttons next to the text area support most STC tags. Clicking a button either inserts a tag at the cursor or wraps selected text:
    - The `a href` button adapts to selected text, inserting an empty tag if none is selected or detecting a link to wrap appropriately with both link and name.
    - The `img` button adapts similarly, detecting image paths and wrapping with source and description.
    - For tags like `[a href=...]` or `[img src=...]`, smart selection splits links/paths and text for proper attribute assignment.
    - If selected text is already tagged, re-tagging with the same tag removes the tags if the selection includes or is within them.
22. **Spellchecking**: Uses the [nuspell](https://nuspell.github.io/) library to check text against a Polish dictionary, underlining non-existent words. Text within STC tags is skipped unless attributes (e.g., image descriptions) require checking.
    - Context menu offers suggestions for correcting typos.

## General Editor Features

The editor is also suitable for general document editing. Here are some standout features not commonly found in other editors:

1. **File Operations**: Load, save, and reload files, with the ability to rename open files.
2. **Recent Files**: Remembers recently opened files and their last cursor positions, including the date of last access.
3. **External Change Detection**: Notifies when a file is modified externally.
4. **Smart Context Menu for Text**:
    - **Line Numbering**: Add or remove numbering for selected lines, with options to fix inconsistent numbering.
    - **Add Bullets**: Add bullet points to each selected line.
    - **Sort Lines**: Sort selected lines, ignoring case.
    - **Join Lines**: Combine multiple selected lines into one, separated by spaces.
    - **Case Conversion**: Convert selected text to lowercase, uppercase, or between camelCase and snake_case.
5. **File Path Copying**: Copy the file's basename or absolute path to the clipboard.
6. **Indentation Controls**: `Tab` indents selected text; `Shift+Tab` unindents.
7. **Shortcut List**: Accessible via the application menu.
8. **Text Search**:
    - Search with options for case sensitivity and whole-word matching.
    - Displays occurrence counts for:
      - Case-sensitive matches.
      - Case-insensitive matches.
      - Case-sensitive whole-word matches.
      - Case-insensitive whole-word matches.
    - `Enter` and `Shift+Enter` navigate to the next/previous match.
    - Up/down arrows navigate matches without shifting focus to the text editor.
    - All matches are highlighted in the text.
9. **Font Scaling**: Increase/decrease font size with `Ctrl++`, `Ctrl+-`, or `Ctrl+Mouse Scroll`.
10. **Status Bar**: Shows the open file's name, number of unsaved changed lines, last edit time, and last save time (visible only with unsaved changes).
11. **Current Line Highlighting**: Tracks the cursor's position within the current line.
12. **Detailed Unsaved Changes**: When exiting with unsaved changes, a diff table shows line-by-line differences, with options to restore specific lines from the disk version. Character-level diffs highlight subtle changes.
13. **Hideable Widgets**: All non-text-editor widgets can be hidden for faster editing.
14. **Multiple File Encodings**: Supports various encodings (not just UTF-8) using the [uchardet](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/uchardet/uchardet) library.
15. **Work Timer**: Tracks both the time the editor is open and active editing time (pauses when no keypresses are detected).

    - Validate tag attributes (e.g., proper quoting, allowed attributes).
    - Ensure only valid STC tags are used.
    - Check if links exist.
    - Prevent closing unopened tags.
    - Ensure `[run]` tags are within `[csv]` or `[pkt]`.

## Mini Bugs

1. Match line numbering size to font size.
2. Font size changes interfere with new tags (e.g., `H1` tags get smaller fonts than the rest of the text).
3. Font size changes should affect line numbering font.
4. Pasting issues: Inserts "strange" characters.

## Collaboration
